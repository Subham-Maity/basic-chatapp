## How to Setup Guide
To set up the chat app, please follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm i`.

2. Run the server by executing `node server.js`.

3. Once the server is running, you will see the following messages:

```bash
Server1 listening on port 3000
Server2 listening on port 3001
```
4. Visit http://localhost:3000/ and http://localhost:3001/ in the browser
5. You will see two basic frontends for client 1 and client 2, and you can communicate between them.
